The Intune Device Migration solution allows devices to be off-boarded from their existing tenant and automatically joined to their destination in a matter of minutes; all while retaining user data.

Using a custom solution that leverages PowerShell scripting, Microsoft Graph API, and Windows provisioning packages, organizations can migrate Windows PCs between tenants with minimal downtime and user disruption.

Full documentation is now available at https://stevecapacity.github.io/intune-device-migration-documentation/ hosted on GitHub pages.

Thanks for stopping by.
